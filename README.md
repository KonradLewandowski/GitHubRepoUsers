# Getting Started with Recruitment Task

Before you start install all dependencies: `npm install` in your terminal.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. I have created 11 tests that ckeck:

- if component rendered
- user entered at least 3 characters
- user did not enter at least 3 characters
- if results are getting render
- alphabetical order
- no more than 50 results are displayed
- if the arrow navigation works (UP/DOWN)
- visual feedback when the data is being fetched, the results are empty, or the request resulted in an error

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
